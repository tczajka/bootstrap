# Number notation

We write numbers as follows:

prefix | base | bytes | notes
------ | ---: | ----: | 
none   | 10   |       | We use base 10 informally.
`%`    | 8    |    1  | Octal bytes are prefixed by `%`.
`$`    | 16   |    1  | Hexadecimal bytes are prefixed by `$`.
`#`    | 16   |    4  | Hexadecimal 32-bit numbers are prefixed by `#`.
`'`    | 256  |    1  | [ASCII](ascii.md) character.

For example: `65` = `$41` = `%101` = `'A`.
