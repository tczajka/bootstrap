# x86-64 machine code

[TOC]

We write all our code for x86-64 CPUs in 64-bit mode.

It is a complicated instruction set. But we will deal with it. We only describe some
common instructions that will be useful to us.

# Registers

There are 16 64-bit registers:

ID  | name  | special uses
--: | ----- | ----------
`0` | `rax` | some instructions use it implicitly
`1` | `rcx` |
`2` | `rdx` |
`3` | `rbx` |
`4` | `rsp` | stack pointer (stack grows down)
`5` | `rbp` | stack frame pointer
`6` | `rsi` | source for string operations
`7` | `rdi` | destination for string operations
`8` | `r8`  |
`9` | `r9`  |
`10`| `r10` |
`11`| `r11` |
`12`| `r12` |
`13`| `r13` |
`14`| `r14` |
`15`| `r15` |

# Moves

## mov reg, reg/memory or mov reg/memory, reg

![mov](../images/x86-64/mov.svg)

Mov instructions copy data between registers and/or memory. This basic move
instruction moves data between a register and another register or memory.

## mov rax, [const.4] or mov [const.4], rax

![mov rax](../images/x86-64/mov_rax.svg)

This is a short opcode for moving the `rax` register to / from memory.

## mov register, const

![mov const](../images/x86-64/mov_const.svg)

This loads a constant value into the register number `B reg`.

## Operand size

The size of the operands is indicated by the `S` (size) and `W` (wide) bits as follows:

`S` | `W`| size     | notation
--- | -- | ----     | ---
  0 |  0 | 1 byte   | `mov.1` (don't use `rsp`, `rbp`, `rsi` or `rdi`)
  1 |  0 | 4 bytes  | `mov.4`
  1 |  1 | 8 bytes  | `mov.8`

There is also a way to specify 2 bytes , but let's ignore that.
It's *not* done by setting the bits to `0 1` (the remaining combination), as you might think!

Whenever 1 byte is used in a register, it is lowest byte of the register.
However, for historical reasons there is an exception. If you specify register number
4-7, and there is no REX byte, it actually means the *second lowest* byte of a register
0-3. We will probably not need this functionality. We just have to be careful not to
try to use the single lowest byte in `rsp`, `rbp`, `rsi` or `rdi`.

Whenever 4 bytes are set in a register (via a `mov` or another operation),
the upper 4 bytes are zeroed.

## Direction

The `D` (direction) bit specifies the direction of an operation

`D` | direction  | notation
--- | -------    | ---
 0  | `mem` <- `reg` (store) | `mov mem, reg`
 1  | `reg` <- `mem` (load)  | `mov reg, mem`

# Memory addressing: ModRM byte

The purpose of the ModRM byte is to describe which register to use, and which
location in memory (or another register) to use.

The register is simpler: it's described by the 4 bits: `R reg` (where `R` comes from the
REX byte). We need the REX.R bit if we want to use registers `r8-r15`.

The memory location depends on the `mod` field.

## `[register]` addressing

![ModRM 00](../images/x86-64/modrm_00.svg)

`mod = 00`. This mode specifies that the register number `B rm`
(where B comes from the REX byte) contains a memory address.

A gotcha: we can't use `rm = 4` or `rm = 5` in this mode!
4 is reserved for [indexed addressing](#indexed-addressing-sib-byte).
5 is reserved for [relative addressing](#rip-const4-addressing).

This means we can't say `[rsp]`, `[rbp]`, `[r12]` or `[r13]` using this mode.
x86-64 is complicated...

Let's encode an example instruction:

```nasm
    mov.4 rbx, [rcx]
```

This instruction moves 4 bytes from memory location addressed by `rcx` to the register `rbx`,
filling the top 4 bytes of `rbx` with 0.

We don't need the REX byte for this. We set `D=1` (load from memory), `S = 1` (4-byte move), 
`mod = 00`, `reg = 3` (`rbx`), `rm = 1` (`rcx`).

![mov example](../images/x86-64/modrm_00_example.svg)

This gives us machine code in octal:
`%213 %031`.
Octal is very convenient because we have groups of 3 bits!

## `[register + const.1]` addressing

![ModRM 01](../images/x86-64/modrm_01.svg)

`mod = 01`. The register number `B rm` contains a memory address,
but we add a 1-byte signed constant to it.

`rm = 4` is reserved for [indexed addressing](#indexed-addressing-sib-byte), so we can't say `[rsp + const.1]` or `[r12 + const.1]` in this mode.

## `[register + const.4]` addressing

![ModRM 10](../images/x86-64/modrm_10.svg)

`mod = 10`. The register number `B rm` contains a memory address,
but we add a 4-byte signed constant to it. This can be used to address byte arrays,
or so specify an offset within a data structure.

`rm = 4` is reserved for [indexed addressing](#indexed-addressing-sib-byte), so we can't say `[rsb + const.4]`
or `[r12 + const.4]` in this mode.

## Two-register operations

![ModRM 11](../images/x86-64/modrm_11.svg)

`mod = 11`. This time the second operand is simply the register indexed `B rm`.
Note that we can describe such a move instruction in two ways, in either direction (`D` bit).

## `[RIP + const.4]` addressing

![relative addressing](../images/x86-64/relative.svg)

Relative addresses are specified relative to the address of the next instruction (`RIP`). The address offset by a given constant from `RIP`, which allows to reference
any constant memory location within +- 2GiB of the code.

## Indexed addressing: SIB byte

Indexed (SIB) addressing is the most complicated form of addressing on x86-64.
It allows compact array indexing.

### `[const.4 + 2^k * index]`

![SIB 00 no base](../images/x86-64/sib_00_no_base.svg)

This can be used for static array access with `2^k` bytes per element.

The array index is the register number `X index`, where `X` comes from the optional
`REX` byte. But we can't use `rsp` as the index.

### `[base + 2^k * index]`

![SIB 00 base](../images/x86-64/sib_00_base.svg)

This can be used for array access with `2^k` bytes per element, whose address
we have in a `base` register.

The base is in register number `B base`, where `B` comes from the optional REX
byte. We can't use `base = 5`, so `rbp` and `r13` are not allowed as the base. This
possibility was taken by the previous addressing mode!

The array index is the register number `X index`, where `X` comes from REX. But we can't use `rsp` as the index.

### `[base + 2^k * index + const.1]`

![SIB 01](../images/x86-64/sib_01.svg)

Same as the previous mode plus a 1 byte offset.

The base is in register number `B base`, where `B` comes from the optional REX
byte. Every register is allowed.

The array index is the register number `X index`, where `X` comes from REX. But we can't use `rsp` as the index.

### `[base + 2^k * index + const.4]`

![SIB 10](../images/x86-64/sib_10.svg)

Same, but with a 4 byte offset.

The base is in register number `B base`, where `B` comes from the optional REX
byte. Every register is allowed.

The array index is the register number `X index`, where `X` comes from REX. But we can't use `rsp` as the index.

# Load address

## lea reg, memory

![lea](../images/x86-64/lea.svg)

This is similar to the `mov reg, memory` instruction, but instead of moving
data from memory, we just store the address of the memory location into a register.

This allows us to reuse the various complicated memory addressing modes to do
address calculations without actually loading data from memory.

If the `W` bit is set, the instruction calculates an 8-byte address, otherwise
it calculates a 4-byte address.

# Auto-increment operations

## `stos`: `mov [rdi], rax`, increment `rdi`

![stos](../images/x86-64/stos.svg)

The `S` and `W` bits indicate the [move size](#operand-size).

## `lods`: `mov rax, [rsi]`, increment `rsi`

![lods](../images/x86-64/lods.svg)

The `S` and `W` bits indicate the [move size](#operand-size).

# Arithmetic and logic

## `op register, memory` or `op memory, register`

![op](../images/x86-64/op.svg)

These instructions perform one of 8 arithmetic and logic operations between and
a register and a register or memory.

Similar to `mov`, the source and destination are described by the
[ModRM byte](#memory-addressing-modrm-byte).

This `D` bit indicates the operation [direction](#direction).
The `S` and `W` bits indicate the [operand size](#operand-size).

## Operation code

The 3 `op` bits specify the kind of operation performed:

`op` | name      | description
---: | --------- | -----------
`0`  | `add`     | add
`1`  | `or`      | bitwise or
`2`  | `adc`     | add with carry from previous operation
`3`  | `sbb`     | subtract with borrow from previous operation
`4`  | `and`     | bitwise and
`5`  | `sub`     | subtract
`6`  | `xor`     | exclusive or
`7`  | `cmp`     | compare (sets flags for subsequent conditional instructions)

## `op rax, const`

![op rax const](../images/x86-64/op_rax_const.svg)

This performs an operation encoded by [`op`](#operation-code) between `rax` and a constant.

The `S` and `W` bits indicate the [operand size](#operand-size).

## `op register/memory, const`

![op rm const](../images/x86-64/op_rm_const.svg)

This performs an operation encoded by [`op`](#operation-code) between a register
or memory location described by the [ModRM byte](#memory-addressing-modrm-byte)
and a constant. Note that `reg` field if the ModRM byte now encodes the operation.

The `S` and `W` bits indicate the [operand size](#operand-size).

The `E` bit describes whether the constant is sign-extended from 1 byte:

`S` | `E` | constant size
--- | --- | --------
0   |  0  | 1 byte
1   |  0  | 4 bytes, sign extended to 8 bytes if necessary
1   |  1  | 1 byte, sign-extended to 4 or 8 bytes

# Opcode map

Here is the map of all the opcodes we have discussed. Rows are indexed by the top
two octal digits, columns are indexed by the last octal digit.
