# x86 machine code

We write all our code for x86 CPUs in 32-bit mode. This is the "protected mode" on
32-bit operating systems or "compatibility mode" on 64-bit operating systems.

We only describe some common instructions that may be useful to us.

## Registers

There are 8 general-purpose 32-bit registers:

ID | name | special uses
-: | ---- | ----------
 0 | eax  | some arithmetic instructions use it implicitly
 1 | ecx  |
 2 | edx  |
 3 | ebx  |
 4 | esp  | stack pointer (stack grows down)
 5 | ebp  |
 6 | esi  |
 7 | edi  |

8-bit instructions use 8-bit fragments of these registers

ID | name | which byte
-: | ---- | ----------
 0 | al   | lowest byte of eax
 1 | cl   | lowest byte of ecx
 2 | dl   | lowest byte of edx
 3 | bl   | lowest byte of ebx
 4 | ah   | second-lowest byte of eax
 5 | ch   | second-lowest byte of ecx
 6 | dh   | second-lowest byte of edx
 7 | bh   | second-lowest byte of ebx

## Moves

Move instructions copy data between registers and/or memory.

Note that we use %, $, # to indicate [octal and hexadecimal numbers](numbers.md).

machine code | assembly      | description
------------ | ------------- | -----------
%210 %0xy    | `movb [y], x` | 8-bit store in memory
%211 %0xy    | `mov [y], x`  | 32-bit store in memory
%212 %0xy    | `movb x, [y]` | 8-bit load from memory
%212 %3xy    | `movb x, y`   | 8-bit copy
%213 %0xy    | `mov x, [y]`  | 32-bit load from memory
%213 %3xy    | `mov x, y`    | 32-bit copy
%26x $y      | `movb x, $y`  | 8-bit load constant
%27x #y      | `mov x, #y`   | 32-bit load constant

## Basic arithmetic and logic

There are 8 basic arithmetic and logic operations:

ID   | op        | description
---: | --------- | -----------
`0`  | `add`     | addition
`1`  | `or`      | bitwise or
`2`  | `adc`     | add with carry
`3`  | `sbb`     | subtract with borrow
`4`  | `and`     | bitwise and
`5`  | `sub`     | subtraction
`6`  | `xor`     | exclusive or
`7`  | `cmp`     | compare (`sub` without storing result)

Basic arithmetic instructions are encoded similarly to moves:

machine code | assembly      | description
------------ | ------------- | -----------
`%0p0 %0xy`  | `opb [y], x`  | 8-bit arithmetic to memory
`%0p1 %0xy`  | `op [y], x`   | 32-bit arithmetic to memory
`%0p2 %0xy`  | `opb x, [y]`  | 8-bit arithmetic from memory
`%0p2 %3xy`  | `opb x, y`    | 8-bit arithmetic
`%0p3 %0xy`  | `opb x, [y]`  | 32-bit arithmetic from memory
`%0p3 %3xy`  | `op x, y`     | 32-bit arithmetic
`%0p4 $y`    | `opb al, $y`  | 8-bit arithmetic of al with a constant
`%0p5 #y`    | `op eax, #y`  | 32-bit arithmetic of eax with a constant
`%200 %3px $y` | `opb x, $y` | 8-bit arithmetic with a constant
`%201 %3px #y` | `op x, #y`  | 32-bit arithmetic with a constant
`%203 %3px $y` | `op x, $y`  | 32-bit arithmetic with a sign-extended 8-bit constant

## Other arithmetic

machine code | assembly      | description
------------ | ------------- | ---------------
`%10x`       | `inc x`       | increment by 1
`%11x`       | `dec x`       | decrement by 1
`%205 %3xy`  | `test x, y`   | `and x, y` without storing the result
`%301 %34x $y` | `shl x, $y` | shift `x` left by `y` bits
`%301 %35x $y` | `shr x, $y` | signed shift `x` right by `y` bits
`%301 %37x $y` | `sar x, $y` | unsigned shift `x` right by `y` bits

## Stack operations

Pushing on the stack means decrementing esp by 4 and storing the value at `[esp]`.
Popping off the stack is the opposite operation.

Calling a function pushes the return address on the stack. Returning from the function pops
it off the stack.

machine code | assembly      | description
------------ | ------------- | ---------------
`%12x`       | `push x`      | push on the stack
`%13x`       | `pop x`       | pop off the stack
`%350 #rel`  | `call #rel`   | call function, `rel`: 32-bit relative address
`%303`       | `ret`         | return from a function

## Jumps

machine code | assembly    | description
------------ | ----------- | ---------------
`%377 $rel`  | `jmp $rel`  | jump, `rel`: 8-bit relative address
`%351 #rel`  | `jmp #rel`  | jump, `rel`: 32-bit relative address
`$7q $rel`   | `jq $rel`   | conditional jump, `q`: condition, `rel`: 8-bit relative address

Conditional jumps are easiest to write in hexadecimal. `$7x` corresponds to `%16x` or `%17x` in octal.

Possible conditions are as follows:

ID  | condition   | description
--: | ----------- | --------------
`0` | `o`         | signed overflow
`1` | `no`        | signed no overflow
`2` | `c` / `b`   | unsigned carry or <
`3` | `nc` / `ae` | unsigned no carry or >=
`4` | `e` / `z`   | equal or zero
`5` | `ne` / `nz` | not equal or not zero
`6` | `be`        | unsigned <=
`7` | `a`         | unsigned >
`8` | `s`         | signed < 0
`9` | `ns`        | signed >= 0
`a` | `p`         | odd parity
`b` | `np`        | even parity
`c` | `l`         | signed <
`d` | `ge`        | signed >=
`e` | `le`        | signed <=
`f` | `g`         | signed >

## System calls

A [system call](syscalls.md) is achieved using interrupt `$80`.

`%315 $x`    | `int $x`      | software interrupt number `x`
